# College ROI
This repo contains code to analyze U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard data.
# Setup
In order to work with these files, create a local "raw_data" subdirectory one directory up from the "college-roi" repository folder. Add all unzipped raw data files from the College Scorecard data page, at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/.
# Notes
- The crosswalks found in the input folder were created using the documentation from the College Scorecard data page.
- The CPS series used is the R-CPI-U-RS (without food and energy) series, available at https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-cpi-u-rs-home.htm
